//! Scenario fact-curation wire DTOs (task 1.x — Phase A).
//!
//! These are the request/response shapes for the three curation routes
//! (`POST` / `DELETE` / `GET` under `/cases/:slug/scenarios/:id/facts`). They
//! sit on top of the existing storage (`scenario_fact_refs`, task 1.2) and the
//! existing graph card content (`bias::dto::BiasInstance`) — Phase A is wiring,
//! not new storage, so there is no new record type here.
//!
//! ## Why reuse `BiasInstance` for the content
//!
//! A `scenario_fact_refs` row stores only a `graph_node_id`; the human-readable
//! content (quote, speaker, ABOUT subjects, document, pattern tags) is read live
//! from the graph. The Bias Explorer already assembles exactly that content into
//! `BiasInstance`. Carrying the saved fact's content *as* a `BiasInstance` means
//! one frontend card renders both a bias candidate and a saved fact, and the
//! backend has one graph→content mapping, not two that can drift (Standing
//! Rule: no duplication / no tech debt).

/// `graph_node_id` is the Neo4j node id of the Evidence being curated in

/// are accepted by the storage layer but are **not surfaced in Phase A**: the
/// `scenario_fact_refs.role_in_this_scenario` / `note` columns exist and round-
/// trip, but no UI authors them yet (role + rebuttal-pairing arrive in a later
/// phase). They are optional here so the column stays ready without forcing the
/// client to send a value.
/// `deny_unknown_fields` so a client typo (e.g. `graphNodeId` instead of
/// `graph_node_id`) is rejected as a 400 rather than silently accepted and the
/// field dropped — matching `ScenarioCreateRequest`'s precedent (Standing

 * id) is simply ABSENT from `pool` and `dropped`. Left unhandled, an orphaned
 * *confirmed* fact would silently disappear from the UI (violates Standing
 * Rule 1 / the ratified orphan policy). This surfaces those refs so the caller
 * can render the "content unavailable" stale card.
 *
 * ## Limitation, deliberately conservative
 *
 * The old `GET …/facts` (`ScenarioFactDto`) carries NO status — so we cannot tell
 * an orphaned *included* ref from an orphaned *dropped* one. We therefore surface
 * EVERY saved ref missing from the gather set. This never hides a confirmed fact
 * (the guarantee), at the cost of also surfacing the rare orphaned-dropped ref —
 * a harmless over-approximation. `knownIds` is the union of the pool's and
 * dropped list's node ids.
